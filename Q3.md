# Q: 3

## Email Word Spam Probability using Bayes' Theorem

### Problem Statement

You are building a simple spam detector. From a dataset of 1000 emails, you have the following information:

- 300 emails contain the word "free"
- 400 emails are spam
- 120 emails are both spam and contain the word "free"

Use this data to compute the probability that an email is spam given that it contains the word "free" â€” i.e., compute: **P(Spam | Free)** using Bayes' Theorem.

### Objective

Estimate: **P(Spam | Email contains "free")**

### Input

Ask the following inputs from the user (and validate them before proceeding):

- `total_emails`
- `emails_with_free`
- `spam_emails`
- `spam_and_free`

### Formula (Bayes' Theorem)

```
P(Spam | Free) = P(Free | Spam) Ã— P(Spam) / P(Free)
```

**Where:**

- **P(Spam)** = `spam_emails` / `total_emails`
- **P(Free)** = `emails_with_free` / `total_emails`
- **P(Free | Spam)** = `spam_and_free` / `spam_emails`

### ðŸ“¤ Expected Output

Print the result: **P(Spam | Free)** with appropriate precision (e.g., up to 4 decimal places)
