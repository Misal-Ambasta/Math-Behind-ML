# Q: 1

## Vector Operations in Python

Write Python functions to:

- Add two vectors.
- Compute the dot product.
- Check if two vectors are orthogonal.

**Sample Input:**
```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = [4, 5, 6]
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Sum: [5, 7, 9]
Dot Product: 32
Orthogonal: False
```

## Matrix Multiplication

Write a Python program that multiplies two matrices using nested loops (without NumPy).

**Test with:**
```python
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
```
