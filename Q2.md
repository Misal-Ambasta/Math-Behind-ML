# Q: 2

## Simulate Rolling Two Dice

### Problem Statement

You are asked to simulate the process of rolling two 6-sided dice 10,000 times and use the results to estimate certain probabilities based on the outcomes.

### Objective

Estimate the following probabilities using simulation (not formula):

- **P(Sum = 7)** â†’ Probability that the sum of two dice equals 7
- **P(Sum = 2)** â†’ Probability that the sum equals 2
- **P(Sum > 10)** â†’ Probability that the sum is greater than 10 (i.e., 11 or 12)

### ðŸ”¢ Input and Output Format

**Input:** No user input is needed. The simulation will internally roll the dice 10,000 times using random number generation.

**Output:** Print estimated probabilities like this:
```
P(Sum = 7): 0.1678
P(Sum = 2): 0.0271
P(Sum > 10): 0.0836
```

*The output values will vary slightly on each run due to randomness.*

### Instructions to Proceed

1. Import random module.
2. Loop 10,000 times:
   - Randomly generate two integers between 1 and 6.
   - Compute the sum of the dice.
   - Count how often the sum is 7, 2, or greater than 10.
3. Divide each count by 10,000 to get the estimated probability.
4. Print the results.
